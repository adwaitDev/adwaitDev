## ℹ️ About me
<p>
I’m a 'Web Developer' with a Master’s degree in Computer Applications (MCA) from VJTI, Maharashtra, India — driven by curiosity and interest for building apps that solve everyday real-world problems. I enjoy learning different layers of technology, working my way around the concepts and upcoming trends. Lately, I've been exploring the AI/ML (Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning) and data side of things to understand the data science domain.
