# ℹ️ About me
<p>
I’m a 'Web Developer' with a Master’s degree in Computer Applications (MCA) from VJTI, Maharashtra, India — driven by curiosity and interest for building apps that solve everyday real-world problems. I enjoy learning different layers of technology, working my way around the concepts and upcoming trends. Lately, I've been exploring the AI/ML (Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning) and data side of things to understand the data science domain.

- Using React and TypeScript as part of my journey into full-stack development, while also familiarizing with MERN/MEAN stacks.
  
- Exploring data-driven insights using Python, Excel, SQL, and Tableau, and practicing hands-on case studies.
  
- Learning how AI/ML models are built and trained using Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, and pandas, while experimenting on Kaggle.

### My Core Interests -

- Collaborate and contribute to open-source projects.
  
- Demonstrate knowledge and skills in hackathons, coding contests or Kaggle competitions.

- Engage and learn something new with the developer and data communities.
